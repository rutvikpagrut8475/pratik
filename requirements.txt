Project Requirements and Complete Workflow
Project Overview
This project is a Python-based console application that manages products stored in a glossary database using SQLite. Users can view available products, add new products, and generate a bill. The project avoids using HTML or any web frontend by providing a terminal-based interface for user interaction.

Project Requirements
Environment:

Python 3.x installed on the system.
SQLite3 (comes bundled with Python).
tabulate library for formatting tables:
bash
Copy code
pip install tabulate
Database:

SQLite database (glossary.db) is used to store product details such as product name, price, and quantity.
Products are managed using SQL operations (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT).
Functional Requirements:

View the list of available products with their details.
Add new products to the database with the product's name, price, and stock quantity.
Generate a bill summary by selecting products from the database and updating their quantities.
Handle invalid inputs and stock shortages gracefully.
